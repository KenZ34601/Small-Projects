<h1>Nim Game</h1>

<p>Nim is two player game. In this case, that means you and the
computer.  When you start the game, a random number of piles
consisting of a random number of stones is put together. Both players
take turns. Each turn a player must remove one or more stones from a
pile. The player that takes the last stone(s) from the only remaining
pile wins. Easy, eh?
